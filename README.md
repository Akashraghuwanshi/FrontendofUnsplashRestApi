## API Integration

This project integrates with the Unsplash REST API to fetch images. Here's how it works:

1. Integration Setup: The project establishes a connection with the Unsplash API by utilizing API keys provided by Unsplash. These keys authenticate requests and ensure secure access to the Unsplash database.
2. Fetching Images: Upon user interaction, such as page load or specific actions, the application sends requests to the Unsplash API. These requests typically include parameters like search queries, image categories, or filters the image results to the user's preferences.
3. Receiving Image Data: The Unsplash API responds to requests with JSON-formatted data containing relevant information about the requested images, including URLs, metadata, and attribution details.
4. Rendering Images: The application dynamically renders the received image data, displaying thumbnails or previews of the fetched images within the user interface. These images are presented in a visually appealing manner, enticing users to engage further.
5. User Interaction: Users can interact with the displayed images through various actions facilitated by the application. This may include options such as liking, downloading, sharing, or viewing additional details about the images and their respective authors.
